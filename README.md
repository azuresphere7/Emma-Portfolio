## Code
I used HTML and CSS with Sass for the site's layout and structure:
- **HTML:** Semantic HTML, Accessibility, and Page Structure
- **CSS:** Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design and Media Queries, and Animation
- **JavaScript:** A small script was used to handle the CSS loader
- **Images:** All images were taken by Matt Mazzocchi
<br><br>

## Tools
- **Adobe Photoshop –** I cropped and compressed original work using Photoshop's image processor.
- **Adobe Color –** I used this color palette generator for ideas and brain storming.
- **Dropbox –** We used Dropbox to transfer images between machines.

## To-do
- [ ] Simplify SASS to remove redundancies
- [ ] Consider injecting HTML using JavaScript
